			<h2 class="q"> Describe what you think it takes...</h2>
			<h3 class="q"> to succeed.</h3>
			<p>I think success is different for everyone.  For someone to be successful, they first have to be able to dream, create a goal that would make them proud, and have fun while reaching it.</p> 
			<p>Second, they have to trust and believe that all the hard work and effort put in to reaching that goal is worth it in the end. </p>
			<p>Third, they must be willing to make a mistake and learn from it.  I know personally that I am not perfect.  But I do know, with the help of others and a positive outlook, I can 'dust my shoulders off' when I make a mistake and fall flat on my face. </p>
			<p>Fourth, they must be able to help others in need around them.  I believe true success is not measured by what accolades you can accomplish by yourself, rather what you can do to help others to become successful and proud of their hard work and accomplishments.</p>

			<h3 class="q"> to become a teacher.</h3>
			<p>I think being a teacher is the second most important job behind being a parent.  With that said, Respect, Patience, and Understanding are all necessary qualities an educator must possess.</p>  
			<p>Teachers have the responsibility to promote and foster an environment where students and student athletes feel safe both academically and physically.  It is in this environment where everyone involved can motivate and strive for deeper understanding and higher learning.</p>

			<h3 class="q"> to bake chocolate chip cookies.</h3>
			<p>If there is one thing I could only eat for the rest of my life, it would be chocolate chip cookies. For starters, you'll need an oven, a mixer, and some bowls.  In terms of ingredients, you can't have enough chocolate chips.  When it comes to recipes, I don't have them memorized unless I use them constantly.  So I usually get on my laptop and do a search of 'chocolate chip cookie recipes.'  My cookies always come out a different from the last batch, but they're always delicious.</p>
			<p>It's funny that I think math and baking cookies have a lot in common.  There is a formula/recipe you should follow to get your result.  But it is important to know that just like different cookies, there is more than one way to get your answer.</p>

			<h2 class="q"> What are your...</h2>
			<h3 class="q"> favorite things to do.</h3>
			<p>Traveling around the world is one of my most favorite things to do.  There is something about going on a journey to a place where you are not in your comfort zone that brings out your true qualities.  It is also great to witness an participate in cities that have hundreds of years of history and adaptation.  I've been to France, England, Philippines, Mexico, Spain, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Italy.  I'm planning on going to Japan before the year is over.</p>

			<p>When I'm not traveling, I definitely like to relax and have friends over.  Sometimes we watch movies, or tv shows, but most of the time we are watching sports like football.  I especially like watching my college football team play. Go Bears!!!</p>

			<h3 class="q"> pet peeves.</h3>
			<p>Haha, I don't like the sound of someone scratching a chalk board. That sound makes my skin crawl.</p>

			<h3 class="q"> favorite movies.</h3>
			<p>I like all types of movies.  I guess it depends on the mood I am in.  It's funny though, I'm always in the mood for a comedy or an action flick.  If it's a funny action movie, it's even better.  The last movie that I watched in the theater that I thought was great was, Batman: The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
